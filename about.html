        <h2>About Our Company</h2>
        <p>
           Welcome to Secure Bank, the institution that takes your credit card security more seriously than you take your New Year resolutions. Our mission is simple: keep your sensitive data out of hacker databases, because frankly, they already have too much to do. Using our “state-of-the-art” monitoring systems (also known as engineers running on coffee and panic), we scan the darkest corners of the internet to make sure your card details aren't being traded like Pokémon cards. If we ever find your information leaked, rest assured — we will immediately take action, notify you politely, and then question every life choice that led to this moment. At Secure Bank, we promise professionalism, confidentiality, and just enough sarcasm to remind you we’re humans, not robots. Your security is our priority — mostly because if things go wrong, we’re the ones who get yelled at.
