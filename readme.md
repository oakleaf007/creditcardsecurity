# 🎭 Secure Bank™ – Totally Serious Frontend  
*A fun, fake, absolutely-not-a-real bank.*

Welcome to **Secure Bank™**, the bank that doesn’t exist… but looks like it does!  
This is just a **frontend showcase**, so don’t worry — no real money, no databases, no hackers (hopefully).

---

## 😂 What This Project Does  
- Pretends to be a bank  
- Pretends to secure your credit card  
- Pretends to check hacker databases  
- Actually just shows some HTML/CSS/JS  
- Basically: it lies, but in a fun way

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ Our “Security”  
We claim to protect your credit card with “advanced technology,”  
which is a professional way of saying:

> **We don't actually store anything… because we don’t know how.**

Our system “scans the dark web” — but that’s just a loading animation and a dramatic warning message.

10/10 realistic experience.  
0/10 actual security.

---

## 🧪 Tech Used  
- **HTML** – because React was too heavy for our lies  
- **CSS** – for making things pretty enough to distract you  
- **JavaScript** – for fake loading screens and “security scans”

---

## 💡 Why This Exists  
Because building a fake bank is easier than dealing with a real one.  
Also… portfolios need cool projects.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer  
This is NOT a real thing.  
Please do NOT enter your real credit card details.  
(Unless you want to donate to my coffee fund — just kidding… maybe.)
We don't have actual database
---

## ⭐ Fun Goals  
- Make people laugh  
- Practice frontend skills  
- Look serious while being absolutely not serious
